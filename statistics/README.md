## Measurements



### Standard Deviation
> Measurement of the amount of variation or dispersnio of a set of values.

- It is expressed in the same unit as the data. E.g. given the set of measurements (0,0,12,12) with a mean of 6, the standard deviation is also 6.

### Standard Error
>  Estimate of the standard deviation.

-  The Sampling distribution  is generated by repeated sampling from the same population and recording of the sample means obtained.  This forms a distribution of different means, and this distribution has its own mean and variance.
- Is a measure of the dispersion of sample means around the population mean.
